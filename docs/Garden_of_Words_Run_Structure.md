# 🌿 Garden of Words — Single Run Flow

## 🌀 Overview
Each run represents your spirit’s descent into a corrupted region of the garden.  
You explore, purify, and gather *Word Seeds* until your aura fades (death), after which you return to your **Conservatory** — your safe, growing hub.

The core loop is a rhythm between **intensity (typing combat)** and **calm (reflection, restoration)**.

---

## 🌱 1. The Descent — Start of a Run

**Narrative Context:**  
You begin at the edge of a new biome — misty, wordless, overrun by corruption.  
Your aura flickers with your current upgrades and “Relics” from the Conservatory.

**Mechanics:**
- Choose one of several available *Biomes* (e.g., Glade, Desert, Marsh).  
- Select 1–2 **Linguistic Relics** (temporary modifiers).  
- A soft poem introduces the area’s theme.  
- The **music is subdued**, inviting focus before action.

## ⚔️ 2. Exploration & Encounter Phase

**Environment:**  
Isometric 2D zones made of stylized natural ruins — glowing runes, mist trails, overgrown letters embedded in stone.  
You move fluidly; enemies appear organically as the world reacts to your aura.

**Enemy Engagement Loop:**
1. **Detection:** When an enemy enters your *Aura Radius*, your **Kill Zone** activates.  
2. **Slow Time:** The world muffles, colors desaturate slightly, and a *word or phrase* appears over each nearby enemy.  
3. **Typing Combat:**  
   - Type the displayed word(s) before the **Aura Timer** expires.  
   - Each typed character pulses outward in your aura, visually purifying the enemy.  
   - Missing or mistyping reduces your timer or damages your aura stability.  
4. **Chaining:**  
   - Success purifies an enemy → expands your aura → may pull more enemies into range.  
   - Continuous flow builds **“Word Momentum”**, extending time dilation and granting combo bonuses.  
5. **Purification Outcome:**  
   - Enemies disintegrate into glowing fragments that fall to the soil, growing flowers or light vines.  
   - You collect **Word Seeds** (used later for upgrades).

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- Each zone increases *word complexity*, adding length, special characters, or full short phrases.  
- Enemies gain **distortion effects** (blurred text, reversed order, partial letters) — more linguistic challenge rather than damage sponges.

## 💫 3. Mid-Zone Rewards & Shops

After clearing an area, time resumes fully.  
A small **Rest Grove** appears — a quiet space for upgrades, reflection, and strategic choices.

| System | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🪷 **Caretaker’s Conservatory (Shop Node)** | Buy upgrades or relics using Word Seeds. Visualized as small sprouts growing around a shrine. |
| 🌿 **Skill Upgrades** | Purchase permanent or temporary abilities (e.g., increased aura size, faster timer recovery, new movement abilities). |
| 🌸 **Word Relics** | Temporary modifiers that change typing mechanics (“mirror words,” “reverse challenge,” etc.). |
| 📖 **Whisper Fragments** | Collect narrative lines — each restores a lost stanza of the world’s poem. |

Players can **pause**, admire the restored environment, and take a **photo** — reinforcing the reflective tone between fights.

## 🌾 4. Zone Transition & Escalation

After a few combat rooms, you enter a **Transition Gate** — a portal made of flowing calligraphy.  
Here you can choose between **paths**, each themed around different word families or emotions:

> “Branch of Calm” — focus on slow, defensive play  
> “Branch of Growth” — faster enemies but more Word Seeds  
> “Branch of Memory” — narrative-heavy route with lore fragments

These branching choices shape your strategy and the tone of your run — emphasizing **player expression** over linear progression.

---

## 🌀 5. Boss Encounter — The Unsaid

At the end of each biome lies a **Thematic Boss**, representing a distortion in communication or thought (e.g., *The Unheard, The Broken Sentence, The Echo*).

**Mechanics Example (The Echo Boss):**
- The boss mirrors your words back incorrectly. You must **retype and correct** them under time pressure.  
- Every phase introduces new linguistic challenges: missing letters, jumbled order, partial visibility.  
- The fight ends not with destruction, but with **reconciliation** — the boss’s words align with yours, and it dissolves into light.

**Rewards:**
- Large cache of Word Seeds.  
- A “Pure Word” — a rare upgrade granting permanent buffs or new abilities (e.g., *Stillness, Flow, Clarity*).  
- Visual bloom of the area — color and music return fully.

## 🪞 6. Return to the Conservatory (Meta Loop)

After a run (victory or defeat), your spirit returns to the **Conservatory**, the serene home space that grows with your progress.

**Here you can:**
- **Spend Seeds** → upgrade categories (Growth, Restoration, Relics).  
- **Decorate the World** → plant trees, flowers, fountains, companions.  
- **Unlock Seasonal Changes** → change lighting and mood.  
- **Reflect on Words** → view your typing stats, most-used words, and poetic summaries like:  
  > “You spoke 341 words of renewal.  
  > 27 of calm.  
  > 1 of sorrow.”

**Optional Serenity Mode:**  
Walk freely through your restored sanctuary, listen to ambient nature sounds, and photograph the garden you’ve built.

---

## 🔁 7. Loop Continuity

Every new run:
- Expands your world visually and narratively.  
- Unlocks new **word themes** and **relics**.  
- Gradually reconstructs the world’s central poem — the “Song of Words.”  
- Keeps combat challenging but beautiful, turning mastery into meditation.
