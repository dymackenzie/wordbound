# 🌿 Wordbound — Refined Roguelike Concept

## ⚙️ Core Identity
A roguelike typing action game about **clearing corruption and restoring balance**, where typing words is both **combat** and **creation**. The faster and more accurately you type, the more beauty you return to the world.

“**Hades meets Spiritfarer meets Typing of the Dead**,” but reimagined through a soft, tranquil lens.

## 🕯️ 1. Enemy Concepts (Non-Cringe, Thematic, Visually Striking)

You can keep the concept of *corruption*, but make it **abstract, elemental, and nature-inspired** — more like natural forces gone awry than “spirits with personalities.”

| Type | Description | Visuals | Behavior |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Echo Wisps** | Fragments of unspoken words that loop endlessly | Wispy, translucent shapes repeating faint sounds | Mimic your typed words back incorrectly — type to correct them |
| **Loomers** | Shadows that blur the meaning of words | Tall, shifting silhouettes made of fog | Blur or scramble your words as you type — “distortion” enemies |
| **Tangles** | Overgrown roots or vines of corrupted text | Tendrils with glowing runes inside | Try to entrap you; type verbs like “cut,” “untangle,” “clear” |
| **Hollows** | Empty shells that absorb nearby light | Like cracked pottery filled with dark ink | Slowly drain your aura radius unless purified quickly |
| **Flickers** | Quick darting fragments of lost thought | Small shards of light that flicker erratically | Require short, fast words — speed challenges |
| **The Unsaid (Bosses)** | Larger manifestations of silence, confusion, or broken syntax | Majestic, calm but heavy designs — think celestial beings, not monsters | Multi-phase typing encounters, often poetic rather than aggressive |

Each enemy feels **conceptual**, **artistic**, and **cohesive** — they embody *language decay*, not evil. That keeps your tone mature and non-cringy.

## 🌸 2. Upgrades & Growth System (Depth + Personalization)

You were totally right that attributes alone aren’t enough. Let’s make upgrades multi-layered — part **abilities**, part **expression**, part **worldbuilding**.

### 🌾 Category A: Growth (Functional Upgrades)
*Upgrades that improve your capabilities in combat.*

| Subtype | Examples | Description |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Aura Enhancements** | Aura Radius, Aura Duration, Aura Regeneration | Increases kill-zone size, extends “slow-time,” or regenerates faster |
| **Word Mastery** | “Speed Typist,” “Graceful Flow,” “Echo Shield” | Improves word accuracy windows, allows small typos without penalty, or gives shields on perfect typing streaks |
| **Sentence Chains** | “Poet’s Flow,” “Prose Burst” | Unlocks multi-word/sentence challenges; completing a sentence purifies multiple enemies at once |
| **Momentum Skills** | “Bloom Dash,” “Echo Step” | Movement abilities tied to word completion; e.g., dashing leaves trails that harm nearby blight |
| **Flow Breakers** | “Still Mind,” “Word Weave” | Special cooldown abilities (e.g., freeze time, restore aura instantly after a perfect chain) |

### 🌼 Category B: Restoration (Decorative + Meta Progression)
*Upgrades that visually and emotionally enrich your home base / conservatory.*

| Subtype | Description | Mechanics |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Flora Collection** | Unlock trees, flowers, fountains, and glowing vines | Each run rewards “Purity Fragments” to plant new life in your garden |
| **Seasonal Change** | Change the palette — spring, dusk, mist, starlit | Unlockable moods tied to achievements or word stats |
| **Creature Companions** | Small non-speaking fauna — moths, koi, birds | Cosmetic but comforting; represent milestones |
| **Photo Mode** | Compose shots of your evolving sanctuary | Integrates seamlessly with the “tranquil sharing” idea |
| **Memory Trees** | Each tree represents a word you’ve typed most | Creates a living diary of your playstyle — personal, poetic |

### 🔮 Category C: Linguistic Relics (Unique Perks & Modifiers)
*Procedural-style modifiers that change how you play each run.*

| Name | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Seed of Reversal** | Typing words backwards purifies faster but costs stamina |
| **Echo Bloom** | Each successful word sends out ripples that extend your aura |
| **Silent Step** | Time slows more dramatically but enemies become faster |
| **Word Mirror** | Enemies project mirrored words (challenge modifier with higher rewards) |
| **Mantra Bloom** | Repeat a mantra (short sequence) to gain a temporary shield |

## 🌺 3. Difficulty & Flow System

Your “aura timer” idea is brilliant — it adds natural tension. Let’s structure it:

- **Entering Kill Zone:** Time slows; a word appears above each enemy in range.  
- **Aura Timer:** You have a few seconds per word (shorter as difficulty rises).  
- **Failure:** If timer ends, the aura collapses and the enemy damages you.  
- **Perfect Typing:** Finishing within the first 50% of the timer gives flow bonuses (e.g., more healing, longer aura extension).  

As difficulty scales:
- Words get **longer** and **thematically tied** to the zone (forest = nature words, desert = introspection, etc.).  
- Later zones unlock **phrases** or **sentences**, requiring rhythm and focus.  
- Bosses introduce **semantic challenges** — e.g., fill in missing letters or synonyms under pressure.  

The system encourages mastery without feeling punishing.

## 🌕 4. Post-Run Serenity Loop
Between runs:
- You return to your **Conservatory**, a serene, slowly growing base.  
- You can spend gathered “Word Seeds” on upgrades or new flora.  
- The world gradually transforms — a visual record of your growth.  
- Each photo you take could include an automatically generated **caption based on your most-used words**, creating soft, poetic “postcards.”  

> “This grove bloomed with patience.”  
> “You spoke 27 words of calm today.”

## 🌸 5. Emotional & Aesthetic Core
- The **roguelike tension** feels meditative, not frantic — every defeat is another ring in the tree’s growth.  
- **Combat** becomes a dance of language and rhythm, not aggression.  
- **Progression** is tangible: every word you type makes the world richer.
